This Notes app was created from scratch with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
Although it's a very simple application, I am very proud of it as it was the very first web app I ever made
I'm looking to improve it's design and add more features such as advanced text formatting and a login/signup option

Note: the sidebar seems to have a positioning problem which I'm currently trying to fix
